## Specs
- Outer dimensions (w/o motor) LxWxH: 37.2 x 28.2 x 48.7 (mm)  
- Filament diameter: 1.75 mm  
- Max feedate: ~1200 mm/min  
- Max flowate: ~48 mm3/s  
- Volume of all printed pats: ~6.14 cm3 (~55% less than Shepa mini, ~63% less than Sailfin and ~52% less than HextrudORT extruder)  
- Weight: <=25g (w/o motor). With LDO-36STH17-1004AHG: <=95g  
- Mirrored version is also available  

There are two versions for different types of BMG drive shaft available. They differ slightly, so check the measurements of your drive shaft and compare it with the CAD model  

This is a BETA release. Files, instructions, and other stuff might change!

## BOM
This extruder is designed to use Shepa mini spare parts. Originally they are BMG dual drive extruder parts, but with one 3x32mm instead of 3x20mm shaft. So you can buy original BMG dual drive spae parts and cut off the shaft by yourself
