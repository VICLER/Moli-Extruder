## Specs
- Outer dimensions (w/o motor) L×W×H: 37.2 × 28.2 × 48.7 (mm)
- Filament diameter: 1.75 mm
- Max feedrate: ~1200 mm/min
- Max flowrate: ~48 mm³/s
- Volume of all printed parts: ~6.14 cm³ (~55% less than Sherpa mini, ~63% less than Sailfin and ~52% less than HextrudORT extruder)
- Weight: <=25g (w/o motor). With LDO-36STH17-1004AHG: <=95g
- Mirrored version is also available

There are two versions for different types of BMG drive shaft available. They differ slightly, so check the measurements of your drive shaft and compare it with the CAD model  

This is a BETA release. Files, instructions, and other stuff might change!

## BOM
This extruder is designed to use Sherpa mini spare parts. Originally they are BMG dual drive extruder parts, but with one 3×20mm shaft instead of 3×32mm shaft. So you can buy original BMG dual drive spare parts and cut off the shaft by yourself.
